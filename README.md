## Summary

The Wireless Assistive Switch Link is a device that enables a wireless connection between an assistive switch and an output device that has a 3.5mm jack. The device also comes pre-set with timing latching settings of 10 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes. This device may be useful for someone who would benefit from a wireless connection between the switch and the output device or using the latching feature for output devices.  It is intended for use by makers. The device is  comprised of off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials is about $40 (plus $40 for component shipping).
